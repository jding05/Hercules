# Hercules
This project is a set of sub-projects, seeking to get us out of our comfort zone by programming in other languages instead of just focusing in C. It lasts for 12 weeks, "recreating" the infamous labors that Hercules had to complete. One labor per week, and each labor only lasts for twelve hours.

# The 12 Labours of Hercules
The 12 Labours of Hercules, an introductory networking project for 42US.

### Labour 00: Nemean Lion

In a virtual machine running the latest stable release of Debian, write a script to change the default ssh port to something hidden.

TODO: Prompt user for non-privileged port number ( > 1024) to determine port number.

### Labour 01: Lernaean Hydra

Goal: Write a functional server in C, which "once started would answer a ping with two pong" (open to interpretation).

### Labour 02: Ceryneian Hind

Goal: Using the 42 API and any language you want, write a program to find the location of other users in the lab at 42US.

> Write a script that takes a text file as a parameter with one login per line and returns the location of each person.
> Handle the errors and absent locations very carefully and logically.

### Labour 03: Erymanthian Boar

>Write a small shell script that when you run it will execute its code on the upcoming 21st of December at 8:42am.
>The content of the script can be anything you want.
>Note: cron is recurring, look for a command that is executed once at a specified time.

### Labour 04: Augean Stables

Goal: Properly free the allocated memory in the C file provided with the project.

### Labour 05: Stymphalian Birds

Goal: In any language, create a project template generator to use for future projects.

### Labour 06: Cretan Bull

Goal: Create a champion (AI) to play in the infamous Corewar arena!

### Labour 07: Mares of Diomedes

Goal: Learn how to diffuse a fork bomb, and how to write one.

### Labour 08: Girdle of Hippolyta

Goal: Using any language (except Bash scripting), write a program to send mail via SMTP.

### Labour 09: Cattle of Geryon

Goal: Using any language, write a server benchmarking program like Siege.

### Labour 10: Apples of Hesperides

> Generate a way to access your virtual machine without a password. If you use a password, you fail.
> If you turn in something very wrong, you fail.
> Learn about ssh and RSA to connect to your virtual machine without a password.

### Labour 11: Capturing Cerberus

(I didn't register for this project)

Goal: Program a proxy in C.
